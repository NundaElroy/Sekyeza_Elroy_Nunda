# Simple Telegram Bot

Sends daily motivational quotes via a Telegram bot.

---

## Features

- Sends one quote daily at a scheduled time (default: 9:00 AM).
- Reads quotes from a list and tracks progress using `state.json`.
- Loops back to the first quote after all quotes are sent.
- Utilizes Python's `schedule` library for timing.
- Allows editing the scheduled time in the `state.json` file using a specific format (e.g., `09:00` for single-digit hours).

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the bot:

### 1. Create the Bot
- Open Telegram and message **@BotFather**.
- Type `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create your bot.
- Copy the bot token provided after setup.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install requests schedule python-dotenv
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following variables:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

Replace `your_token_here` with the token you received from **@BotFather** and `your_chat_id_here` with your chat ID.

### 4. Get Your Chat ID
To obtain your chat ID, follow the steps below:

1. **Via Telegram API:**  
   - Send a message to your bot.
   - Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your bot's token and visit:  
     `https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates`.
   - Look for `'id': 5327830334` in the response (example).

2. **Using the Test Script:**  
   - Run `test.py` in your project directory.
   - Check the response for the chat ID.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The Telegram API may take some time to update. Be patient if the chat ID doesn't appear immediately.

## Run the Bot

To start the bot, execute:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will send one quote daily at 9:00 AM by default. You can modify the scheduled time in the `state.json` file by editing the `"time"` field using the 24-hour format `HH:MM`. **Ensure that single-digit hours are prefixed with a zero (e.g., `09:00`).**

## How It Works

- Reads quotes from a predefined list.
- Tracks the next quote to send and scheduled timing in `state.json`.
- Sends quotes sequentially, looping back to the first quote when all are sent.
- Uses Python's `schedule` library for timing.
